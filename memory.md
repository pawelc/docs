# Neural Turing Machine
Nice experiments tesing if network can learn to copy, use associative memory, model n-gram. Simple differentiable controller which can read and write to 
memory using location addressing (shift) and associative addressing. Controller learns to output weights over the memory and its output is the output of the 
model or can be mixed with output of some other net?
