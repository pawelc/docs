Authors use Archimedean and elliptical copulas to model fuel efficiency data. The data is bivariate where each variable
is the ratio of reported fuel economy by the user to the official value for a car. The 2 variables constitute the 
household with 2 cars.  Authors use exploratory analysis to select correct distributions for marginals and copula
to model dependence. To choose among competing copulas they use some special function to compare goodness of fit
for copulas. They also use BIC and AIC criteria.
