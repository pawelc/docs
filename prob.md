#[Approximating the covariance matrix of GMMs with low-rank perturbations]()
Authors compare different ways of approximating covariance: full, diagonal and diagonal plus perturbation.

#[An overview of composite likelihood methods]()
2011
Thorough overview of composite likelihood methods/pseudo likelihood where we define the missspecified model as product 
of likelihood functions on subsets of variables. The rationale is often the computational complexity. I skimmed over it because
quite extensive.
