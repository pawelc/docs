# Copulas and dependence 
Very nice introduction to copulas and representing dependence using this concept.

#[Approximating the covariance matrix of GMMs with low-rank perturbations]()
Authors compare different ways of approximating covariance: full, diagonal and diagonal plus perturbation.

#[A note on pseudolikelihood constructed from marginal densities]()
2004
TODO
Not completed because to difficult.


#[An overview of composite likelihood methods]()
2011
Thorough overview of composite likelihood methods/pseudo likelihood where we define the missspecified model as product 
of likelihood functions on subsets of variables. The rationale is often the computational complexity. I skimmed over it because
quite extensive.

# A Tutorial on Fisher Information

“The (unit) Fisher information is a measure for the amount of information that is expected within the prototypical trial X about the parameter of interest θ. 
It is defined as the variance of the so-called score function, i.e., the derivative 20 of the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameter”
