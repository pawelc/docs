ADMG (Acyclic Directed Mixed Graph) are generalization on Directed graphs to contain bi-directional edges.
The can encode more independence assumptions. It is hard to parametrized likelihood functions to  
encode independence assumptions in ADMG. Authors parametrize cdf using product of CDFs. Not finished.

Another class of PGM is CDN (Cumulative Distribution Function) introduced in \citep{HuangJim2012Cdna}. 
They enable to model distribution functions in terms of factors of cumulative distribution functions. 
This allows to remove the need for latent variables. It also replaces the requirement of summation/integration for inference 
into use of limit/differentiation \citep{HuangJc2011CDNa}.
