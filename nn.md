# A statistical view of deep learning 
DNN = Recursive Generalized Linear Models
Autoencoders as Variational approach to learning generative models.
RNN as state space models with deterministic dynamics.
Maximum likelihood, MAP and overfitting. But they lack transformation invariance.
Thoughts when model is deep.
