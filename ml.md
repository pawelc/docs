Overview of different ways of differentiation: numerical, symbolic and autodiff. Report present how to efficiently compute
gradient with respect to tied parameters like in RNN. Examples showing autodiff and parameter tying.

Good survey of AD methods. How they refer to other methods like backpropagation. History. Application in different areas
of machine learning. Summarize in my thesis.
