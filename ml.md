# [Parameterizing correlations: A geometric interpretation]()
2007

How to parametrize the correlation matrix using full or reduced rank unconstrained parametrization. The parametrization
that enforces the correlation matrix to be PSD. Albeit got slightly worse results than our method.

Overview of different ways of differentiation: numerical, symbolic and autodiff. Report present how to efficiently compute
gradient with respect to tied parameters like in RNN. Examples showing autodiff and parameter tying.

Good survey of AD methods. How they refer to other methods like backpropagation. History. Application in different areas
of machine learning. Summarize in my thesis.
